# School-Management-System

Schools are growing under the influence of technology, and many processes face complexity in this development.
Automation systems are installed to solve this complexity. As we know, all systems in the school are automation systems. 
However, while these automation systems are integrated into schools, users are ignored, so these automation systems do not provide efficient use. 
In our project, we placed users at the center of our focus.
For example, the school administration (1st user) will open some courses, determine the appropriate times for the courses, adjust the authorization of teachers and students,
and examine the log file in which the events and actions are recorded. 
Teachers (2nd user) will be able to assign a syllabus link for the lessons, specify the appropriate hours for the office, upload students' exam grades to the system, and adjust the grade-letter distribution.
Later, students (3rd user) will be able to select their courses, see their teacher's office hours, make an appointment, and see their grades through this system. 
In this way, we will alleviate the difficulties in school systems and highlight the important points in such systems.
